# RePharm

In the Covid scenario there is a shortcoming of a lot of Healthcare material like oxygen,medicines etc. In our project we tackle the problem of shortcoming of medicines. A lot of medicines are available at recovered patient's houses which are of no use to them now and there is a lack of medicines in the pharmacy . Also sometimes due to the cost of medicines people cannot but them. Our project tries to solve this problem by connecting these two people.
